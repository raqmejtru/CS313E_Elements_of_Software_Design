# Singly Linked List

You will be writing helper methods for the LinkedList class that we developed and testing them.

For this task assume that the data that you are handling are integers.

Implement the following methods:
``` 
# Get number of links of a singly Linked List.
# "Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
# "Expected: 6"
def get_num_links (self):

# Add an item at the beginning of the list
def insert_first (self, data):

# Add an item at the end of a list
def insert_last (self, data):

# Add an item in an ordered list in ascending order
# Assume that the list is already sorted
def insert_in_order (self, data):


# Search in an unordered list, return the link if found, None if not found
def find_unordered (self, data):


# Search in an ordered list, return the link if found, return None if not found
def find_ordered (self, data):

```
