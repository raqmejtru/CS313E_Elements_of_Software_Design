# Spelling Test

Given a string `s` and a list of strings `l`, 
determine whether `s` can be spelled by some combination of strings in `l`, 
using each string in `l` **no more than once**. 

You should apply a **recursive** technique.


Input:  
```  
# The first line of input will contain the string s.
string  

# Each subsequent line will contain one element in the dictionary l.
str
ng
in
```
Output: 
```  
False  # The output will be the boolean value representing whether `s` can be spelled.
```


Explanation: The closest combination would yield `strinng`, which has one too many `n` characters.
